<p>For humans, an evolving species, everything revolves around technology. In the digital world, we need to save energy in every possible way and also maintain our comfort levels.
 So we need a Smart city. It is mainly controlled by Al. The main components are internet and energy saving resources. 
 First, we need conservation on light and Wi-Fi, most used parts of electromagnetic spectrum.
 Light is in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum and Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) is at the invisible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. But there is a way of mixing them.
 This is known as Li-Fi (Light Fidelity). Li-Fi is a mobile wireless technology that uses light rather than radio frequencies to transmit data. The technology is supported by a global ecosystem of companies driving the adoption of Li-Fi, the next generation of wireless that is ready for seamless integration into the 5G core. 
 Li-Fi comprises of multiple light bulbs that form
 a wireless network. When an electrical current is
 applied to a LED light bulb a stream of light (photo
ns are emitted from the bulb The signal can then
be received by a detector which interprets the 
changes in light intensity (the signal) as data.
Li - Fi is an essential part of this smart city. It is the transfer of large data through the photons of mainly artificial light but can be done with the help of solar panels since the light energy of the sun is very high and can be used by the lamps for power generation and light also. 
In night the light can be charged with the help of a satellite which can take the solar energy and pass 50% of energy to a main solar panel which is connected to every light in the world.
This technology can also be used for fire emergency. Whenever there is a fire, there will be a loud siren.</p>
<p>Tractor beam
Next is the construction sector. While construction, crane is used to lift huge things at the top of the building.
 Heavier the thing is, more energy is used. A tractor beam uses its beams to carry heavy load at less power.
 A tractor beam is a device with the ability to attract one object to another from a distance.
 Tractor beams use the power of sound to hold particles in mid-air, and unlike magnetic levitation, they can grab most solids or liquids. 
 This would have a huge impact on the construction sector of the world. The light would pull an object toward the source of beam even though the beam has the same intensity along its length.</p>

 

<p>Smart urban farm
 
The last but not least is a smart urban farm. The amount of energy used for transporting goods from one place to the other takes a lot of energy. 
So we can save some energy by having an urban farm with some modern techniques to save resources. So we use an urban smart farm.
 It will have the best type of irrigation system, drip irrigation system.
 The smart city of dreams and wonders will be an energy saving and comfort zone with the best features for everyone. </p>
